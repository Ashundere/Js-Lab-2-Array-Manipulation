### JS Lab 2: Array Manipulation

## Overview
Practicing Array Manipulation by creating a shopping list in html and javascript

## Approach
I started by creating the functions requested in task 1 and 2, then modifying them to work for task 3.

## Difficulties
Getting the list to render was a little difficult, especially because I didn't want to copy from the lesson. So I made it all on my own and used the lesson as a reference only. This meant that I used a different method of iterating through the array.

## Reflection Questions

# How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?
    Array methods allowed me to manipulate the array so that I could add items, remove items, and search for items in the array I created.
# What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?
    I realized that I would have to lowercase or uppercase both the items and the search term in order to have it not be case-sensitive. But I had a little trouble at first because I forgot about filter and was using find at first, which of course doesn't return everything that you need. Then I remembered about filter, which I used in addition to includes to succeed.
# How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?
    I would add the alert for the duplicate items on list that I created for one of the tasks. But otherwise, I could make the webpage look a little better. I don't think I know enough about JS to make it any more efficient at the moment!
